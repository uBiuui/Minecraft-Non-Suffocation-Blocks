# Minecraft Java Edition: Non Suffocation Blocks
List of blocks living entities can't suffocate in, MC 1.13, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18.

## Usage
For use in datapacks as a block tag.

Pick a "safe" or "normal" list for the version you desire, then put the choosen file in this directory of your datapack:

`DATAPACK NAME/data/NAMESPACE/tags/blocks/`

#### "Safe" vs "Normal":

Normal lists include all blocks that living entities can't suffocate in, regardless if the block affects living entities in other ways.

Safe lists include all blocks that living entities can't suffocate in, minus any blocks that might affect living entities. Such "unsafe" blocks are included below:

- campfire (1.14+)
- conduit (1.13+) [Only unsafe in 1.13.0 due to being waterlogged]
- end_gateway (1.13+)
- end_portal (1.13+)
- fire (1.13+)
