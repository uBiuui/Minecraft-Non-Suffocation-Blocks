# Minecraft Non Suffocation Blocks
List of blocks living entities can't suffocate in, MC 1.13-1.17+.

For use in datapacks as a block tag.

Put it in this directory of your datapack:
`DATAPACK_NAME/data/NAMESPACE/tags/blocks/`

If you add to this list, please try just adding the individual blocks 
instead of other block tags to improve compatibility with older versions (unless the block tag was present in 1.13).


NOTE:
Even though you can't technically suffocate in the following blocks, other behaviors may impact living entities: 
- campfire
- end_gateway
- end_portal
- fire
- lava
- lava_cauldron
- nether_portal
- pointed_dripstone
- powder_snow
- soul_campfire
- soul_fire
- sweet_berry_bush
- water
