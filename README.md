# Minecraft-Non-Suffocation-Blocks
List of blocks living entities can't suffocate in, MC 1.17.

For use in datapacks as a block tag.

Put it in this directory of your datapack:
`NAMESPACE/data/NAMESPACE/tags/blocks/`

If you add to this list, please try just adding the individual blocks 
instead of other block tags to improve compatibility with older versions.
